# Shared Libraries Requirements
#
# This file intentionally contains no external dependencies.
# All shared library modules use only Python standard library components:
# - subprocess, logging, csv, datetime, os, re, shutil, signal, sys, typing
#
# This approach ensures:
# - No version conflicts across different projects
# - Easy integration into existing Python environments  
# - Minimal setup requirements for new projects
# - Consistent behavior across different Python installations
#
# Future considerations for optional enhancements:
# (These would be optional extras, not required dependencies)
#
# For enhanced CLI support:
# click>=8.0.0          # Rich command-line interfaces
# rich>=10.0.0          # Enhanced console output with colors and formatting
#
# For data validation:  
# pydantic>=1.9.0       # Runtime data validation and settings
#
# For testing enhancements:
# pytest>=6.0.0         # Advanced testing framework
# pytest-cov>=2.0.0     # Coverage reporting
#
# Current philosophy: Keep it simple, standard library only.
# Add dependencies only when there's a compelling need across multiple projects.
